# dflmock
Dflmock is simply a mockup of the Dumb Friends League website. This was my second project using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I completed this before moving on to online coding courses.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to continue learning CSS and Bootstrap in the most painful way possible-- by recreating a site beyond the complexity of my current skill set.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Things I Learned

- Bootstrap grid system
- how to make an input field with a button
- how to append
- more practice with spans
- changing the shape of images
- vanilla CSS
